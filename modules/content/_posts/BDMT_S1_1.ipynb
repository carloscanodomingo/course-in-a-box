After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place.

    "* **Tuples** are just like lists, but you can't change their values. The values that you give it first up, are the values that you are stuck with for the rest of the program. Again, each value is numbered starting from zero, for easy reference. Example: the names of the months of the year.\n",
    "* **Dictionaries** are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In Python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they aren't in any specific order, either - the key does the same thing. You can add, remove, and modify the values in dictionaries. Example: telephone book."

    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def greet():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "# Exercise 2: Function with Return Value\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand how to use return values from functions.\n",

    "  - A function can return a value using the `return` statement.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def add(a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "  Write a function `multiply` that takes two numbers as input and returns their product. Test the function with two numbers and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 3: Function with Conditional Logic\n",
    "**Objective:** Combine functions with if-statements to make decisions.\n",
    "- **Explanation:** \n",
    "  - Functions can include control flow like `if` statements to make decisions based on conditions.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def check_even(number):\n",
    "        if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            return \"Even\"\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"Odd\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Task:**  \n",
    "  Write a function `is_adult` that takes an age as input. If the age is 18 or more, return \"Adult\", otherwise return \"Minor\". Call the function and print the result for a given age.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 4: Using Lists with Functions\n",
    "**Objective:** Work with lists inside a function.\n",
    "- **Explanation:** \n",
    "  - Functions can accept lists as arguments and manipulate them.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def count_items(my_list):\n",
    "        return len(my_list)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Task:**  \n",
    "  Write a function `add_item` that takes a list and an item as arguments. It should add the item to the list and return the updated list. Call the function with a list of fruits and a new fruit to add.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 5: Function that Calls Another Function\n",
    "**Objective:** Learn how to call one function from inside another function.\n",
    "- **Explanation:** \n",
    "  - Functions can call other functions, which is useful for breaking down tasks.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def square(n):\n",
    "        return n * n\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def cube(n):\n",
    "        return n * square(n)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Task:**  \n",
    "  Write two functions: `get_discount(price)` that returns 10% of the price, and `apply_discount(price)` that subtracts the discount from the price. Test the functions with a sample price.\n"
